Determining your weight status.
========================
This is an application to determine your weight status based on your BMI.

To get your BMI and weight status, kindly input your height (in metres) and weight (in kg) and click the submit button.

Your inputs, BMI and weight status will appear in the right panel.

Note that the minimum and maximum weight accepted is 40 kg and 120 kg respectively.
The minimum and maximum height accepted is 1.5 m and 2.0 m respectively.

If your weight is above 120 kg, you are most likely obese (unless you are taller than 2.0 m).

If your weight is below 40 kg, it is highly likely you are underweight.
